# Assestment
This assesment was done with the objective to show (step by step) how to create a script on python
that help us to automatize the collection, cleaning and export of the data needed.

It was used different libraries in order to have the script completed. List below:
    * import gspread
        from gspread_dataframe import set_with_dataframe
    * import pandas as pd
    * import mysql.connector as sql
    * import sqlalchemy as sa
    * from sqlalchemy import create_engine

It is necessary to install these libraries by doing following:
    Into py terminal, type:
        * pip install gspread
        * pip install gspread_dataframe
        * pip install pandas
        * pip install mysql-connector-python
        * pip install sqlalchemy

Google API's was enabled in order to get access and permissions to use Google SpreadSheets and its functions (json keys used)
SQL WorkBench was used for the purpose of the exercise
